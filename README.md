# medical_billing
Proof of concept that creates a multi-page word document of medical billing data that is seperated by page breaks.  Example JSON formatted data from a CSV file is provided as a static variable in the example python script.

- To run this program, you will need to install the `python-docx` package onto your computer:
  ```shell
  pip install python-docx --user
  ```
  
- The billing file created by this program will be located in the same directory that you run this program from.
